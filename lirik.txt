Imagine all the people living life in peace
You may say I'm a dreamer but I'm not the only one
I hope someday you'll join us and the world will be as one
Here comes the sun, it's alright
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be, whisper words of wisdom, let it be
All you need is love, love, love is all you need
We are the world, we are the children
I will survive, oh as long as I know how to love I know I'll stay alive
It's a beautiful day, don't let it get away
Don't stop believin', hold on to that feelin'
Hakuna Matata, what a wonderful phrase
Just keep swimming, just keep swimming
I believe I can fly, I believe I can touch the sky
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
You can't always get what you want, but if you try sometimes, you just might find, you get what you need
Shine bright like a diamond
We found love in a hopeless place
Don't worry about a thing, every little thing is gonna be alright
I got the eye of the tiger, a fighter, dancing through the fire
I'm gonna live like tomorrow doesn't exist
Because I'm happy, clap along if you feel like a room without a roof
I'm on the pursuit of happiness and I know everything that shines ain't always gonna be gold
Just a small-town girl, living in a lonely world
I see trees of green, red roses too, I see them bloom for me and you
Sweet child o' mine, sweet love of mine
You are my sunshine, my only sunshine, you make me happy when skies are gray
Take me home, country roads, to the place I belong
I wanna dance with somebody, I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Oh baby, baby, it's a wild world, it's hard to get by just upon a smile
It's a new dawn, it's a new day, it's a new life for me and I'm feeling good
All the single ladies, now put your hands up
Every breath you take, every move you make, I'll be watching you
I'm walking on sunshine, and don't it feel good?
Uptown girl, she's been living in her uptown world
I'm gonna soak up the sun, gonna tell everyone to lighten up
Hit me with your best shot, why don't you hit me with your best shot?
It's raining men, hallelujah, it's raining men, amen
I see a red door and I want it painted black
And I think to myself, what a wonderful world
Hey Jude, don't make it bad, take a sad song and make it better
I'm a Barbie girl, in a Barbie world, life in plastic, it's fantastic
I'm a survivor, I'm not gonna give up, I'm not gonna stop, I'm gonna work harder
We will, we will rock you
I want to break free, I want to break free from your lies
You are the dancing queen, young and sweet, only seventeen
I will always love you
I can't get no satisfaction, but I try, and I try, and I try
Here comes the sun, doo-doo-doo-doo
I see your true colors shining through
Rolling in the deep, you had my heart inside of your hand
